IR-HSI-Microplastics-analysis-pipeline
A database for plastic spectra and a processing pipeline for infrared hyperspectral images to detect microplastics.

Two sample images are included in the input folder, one called "grid" which shows a swatch of each polymer type (pe, PS, PP, PET) to demonstrate classification of four different polymer types. Another image called "sample image" shows a small subsection of a real MP sample taken from the marine environment. 

The script titled "visualization" shows some sample code of how the data could be plotted if further visualization is desired.
